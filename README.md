# National Climate Data Center – NOAA

NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) is responsible for preserving, monitoring, assessing, and providing public access to weather data. 

NCDC provides access to daily data from the U.S. Climate Reference Network / U.S. Regional Climate Reference Network (USCRN/USRCRN) via anonymous ftp

let me see a complex mapreduce program on weather dataset. Here I am using one of the dataset of year 2021 of  Austin, Texas . We will do analytics on the dataset and classify whether it was a hot day or a cold day depending on the temperature recorded by NCDC.
NCDC gives us all the weather data we need for this mapreduce project.
